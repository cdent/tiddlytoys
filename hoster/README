Hoster is a plugin for TiddlyWeb that hosts TiddlyWikis.

It aggregates a lot of functionality to explore how multi-user
TiddlyWiki hosting might work. It is a prototype and is not 
intended to be a complete system with an excellent UI. Instead
it explores the structure of the application to see where there
are gaps, patterns, opportunities.

You can make a new hoster instance, once the package has been
installed, with the 'betsy' command:

 $ betsy place
 $ cd place
 $ twanager server
 $ ope http://0.0.0.0:8080/
