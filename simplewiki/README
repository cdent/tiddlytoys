A simple wiki for TiddlyWeb, entirely server side, that puts a Wiki,
using markdown syntax plus wiki words, at /wiki.

This plugin, in addition to a quite pleasant wiki (old skool yo!),
demonstrates some of the available techniques for packaging and
distributing an application created with TiddlyWeb.

It uses tiddlywebplugins.templates to manage templates which
may be overriden per instance.

It uses tiddlywebplugins.instancer to manage the creation of
instances with default structure and content in the store.

Its initial development directory filesystem layout has been
established by the TiddlyWeb pluginmaker template repostiry:
http://github.com/tiddlyweb/pluginmaker/

To install and run get pip (and optionally virtualenv) and then:

* pip install tiddlywebplugins.simplewiki
* simplewiki mywiki
* cd mywiki
* twanager server
* open http://0.0.0.0:8080/wiki

If you want to use simplewiki in an existing TiddlyWeb instance,
add 'tiddlywebplugins.simplewiki' to 'system_plugins' and:

* twanager bag wiki </dev/null
* echo "/bags/wiki/tiddlers" | twanager wiki recipe
* # restart your server, go to /wiki

If you wish to use a different recipe (you can use whatever
you like) set 'simplewiki.recipe' in tiddlywebconfig.py.
